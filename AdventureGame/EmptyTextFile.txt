You hop off the train at the Ponyville station excited to reunite with your friends!

But something's not right... Ponyville is eerily quiet. The normally bustling streets are deserted. 
 
What's going on?

1. You're totally freaked out! You get back on the train. If you take it all the way to the Crystal Empire, maybe Princess Cadance can help.
2. You carefully proceed into town, glancing around for signs of what might be going on.
