  storyText: "You hop off the train at the Ponyville station excited to reunite with
    your friends!\n\nBut something's not right... Ponyville is eerily quiet. The normally
    bustling streets are deserted. \n \nWhat's going on?\n\n1. You're totally freaked
    out! You get back on the train. If you take it all the way to the Crystal Empire,
    maybe Princess Cadance can help.\n\n2. You carefully proceed to the town square."
